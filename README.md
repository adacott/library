# odin-library

From the odin course content. Shows a great proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I created a responsive webpage that will work for mobile devices as well as desktop that allows you to keep track of books you have or have not read.
This lesson had a major focus on javaScript objects, as the main mechanism of this library app stores Book objects inside of an array for management.
